# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to make the UFO Sighting data (file data.js) easily accesible by providing relevant filters to view the many rows of information. 

## Results
Someone may use the new webpage using the search criteria filters. As an example, someone may look for all the UFO sightings in California by typing "CA" in the search field. The same searches can be made to the other filters and the data

The webpage will use this input and show the data rows that match exactly this input (===).

The below are the filters available:
 - Date
 - City
 - State
 - Country
 - Shape

## Summary
The largest downside to this analysis is that there is a limited amount of filters and that when there is not a match there is no explanation. To solve this there should bse a default row that appears that informs the reader that there is no data that matches the parameters attempted. 

Also there is limitation at the dual filters able to be entered per field. For example if a user wanted to search for UFO sightings in both California and Oregon for instance, this would need to be done seperately.
